# JavaScript Promises and Async/Await Cheatsheet

Have you ever wondered about another JavaScript cheat sheet with the MDN Web Docs already out there? Good catch! Here's the deal, though â€“ this one's a bit personal. Sure, it's open for everyone, but the main gig? It's my go-to resource. 
I like reinforcing the basics by applying specific techniques, like repetition.

Now, here's the kicker:
I've got to explain these concepts in my own words, like leaving little 'reminders' for myself. 

The catch? 

It should be crystal clear to anyone I explain it to. So, what's in this repository? Well, dive into the source codes, and you'll find examples of everyday use cases of Promises, Async/Await, and the nitty-gritty of execution order.

I have plans to make it a community thing, but time's playing hard to get right now. Oh, and there's a little bonus â€“ a printable cheat sheet. Perfect for beginners who are still getting cozy with the syntax of these concepts. It's a work in progress, but feel free to dive in and explore! ðŸš€âœ¨
